  "FAQ": {
    "badge": "FAQ",
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Get your questions answered about Job Matches",
    "q1": "How does the resume generation process work?",
    "a1": "You fill in your profile, paste the job description, and our AI analyzes the compatibility between your experience and the job requirements. Then it generates an optimized resume with the right keywords, professional formatting, and content tailored to that specific position.",
    "q2": "Does AI really improve my resume?",
    "a2": "Yes! Our AI is trained with thousands of successful resumes and real job requirements. On average, users see a 92% increase in match score after optimization, resulting in 3x more interview invitations.",
    "q3": "What is ATS and why does it matter?",
    "a3": "ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is the software used by most companies to filter resumes before a recruiter sees them. Our AI optimizes your resume with the right keywords and formatting so it passes these filters and reaches the recruiter's hands.",
    "q4": "Can I create resumes for different jobs?",
    "a4": "Yes! Each resume is tailored to a specific job description. You can create as many resumes as you want, each optimized for a different position. Just use 1 credit per resume generated.",
    "q5": "What resume templates are available?",
    "a5": "We offer two professional templates: Modern (two-column layout with colored sidebar) and Classic (traditional single-column format). Both are optimized for ATS systems and designed to impress recruiters.",
    "q6": "In which languages can I create my resume?",
    "a6": "You can choose the language in which your resume will be generated. Our platform supports any language — just select the desired language during the creation process, and the AI will generate the optimized resume in that language. Apply to jobs anywhere in the world.",
    "q7": "How does the credit system work?",
    "a7": "Each generated resume consumes 1 credit and each interaction with the Training Agent consumes 1 credit. Your credits never expire. Purchase credit packages according to your needs and use them whenever you want.",
    "q8": "Does the Training Agent ask questions about my field?",
    "a8": "Yes! The training agent analyzes the job and your resume to ask specific technical and behavioral questions. If you're a developer, it asks about code. If you're in sales, it simulates real objections.",
    "q9": "How long does it take to generate a resume?",
    "a9": "The entire process takes just a few minutes. After you fill in your profile and paste the job description, our AI generates the optimized resume in under 60 seconds. You can download it immediately in PDF format, ready to send.",
    "q10": "Is my data secure?",
    "a10": "Completely. We use end-to-end encryption, do not sell your data, and you can delete your account and information at any time. We are GDPR compliant."
